## Features :heavy_check_mark:
* Simple to use
* Fast and beautiful design
* We used material design & UX library to build this application
* We used MVC design pattern
* Password hashed
*... and more

## Problematic :worried:
1. Lack of tools to establish a student knowledge base.
2. Lack of traceability.
3. We can not judge the efforts of each student (people who work and who doesn't work).
4. Lack of time to evaluate the student.
5. Problem of manual entry in practical work.

## Objectives :smiley:
1. Gives a portable solution and H24 work to gain this understanding.
2. Automate manual stains.
3. Archive students essays at the time of TP.
4. Help the teacher to evaluate the student.
